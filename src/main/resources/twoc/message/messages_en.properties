systemsummary.summary = Summary
systemsummary.summary.content = Mean temperature of the Earth can be sustained by sea ice, which can keep the pole cold by reflecting the solar energy coming into the Earth. However it is likely that recently Arctic sea ice extent shows rapid reduction pattern due to the high temperature around the Arctic area. Since late 1979, satellite retrieval has been started and there is never reported the sea ice extent hit under 4,000,000 \u33A2, however September 2012, it has been recorded low 3,600,000 \u33A2. The reduction of sea ice extent accelerates global warming and the climate change in Arctic also affects Korean peninsula. Many published researches lately reveals cold wave, heat wave, and drought occurred in Korea related to the reduction of Artic sea ice. Additionally, the sea ice reduction has an important role to decide the Arctic shipping routes. As a countermeasure of this recent change, Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) started to operate \u201CArctic Sea Ice Monitoring System\u201D for the surveillance purposes using Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) satellite data. The system provides up-to-date monitoring results every week and also provides \u201CArctic analysis report\u201D every six months.
systemsummary.extent = Sea Ice Extent 
systemsummary.extent.content = Sea ice extent is derived based on spaceborne sea ice concentration data. The system provides sea ice extent information since  January 1st, 2007. 
systemsummary.roughness = Small-Scale Sea Ice Surface Roughness 
systemsummary.roughness.content = Small-scale sea ice surface roughness is physically based on the surface roughness properties. KMA exclusively developed roughness retrieval algorithm based on the polarization and provides weekly averaged roughness on the webpage. The physical states, according to the surface roughness is as follows; 
systemsummary.roughness.content.water = water : roughness < 0.2 cm
systemsummary.roughness.content.mixed = mixed : 0.2 cm < roughness < 0.4 cm
systemsummary.roughness.content.icesnow = ice/snow : roughness > 0.4 cm
systemsummary.changes = Sea Ice Change 
systemsummary.changes.content = Sea ice properties show an extinctive periodic fluctuation pattern according to seasonal changes. Polar nights occur in the Arctic during winter month (September-March). In this period, sea ice grows gradually and reaches the peak in September. Reversely, during summer month (March-September), sea ice receives direct sunlight and it declines at a steady until hitting the lowest record in March. Besides, the roughness declines with the sea ice extent reduction but its minimum usually one month ahead before the minimum of sea ice extent. In other words, sea ice roughness can be used as an indicator expecting the period of lowest sea ice extent.
systemsummary.fcst =  Forecast
systemsummary.fcst.content = Sea ice changes have an important role in the aspects of climate change. Furthermore, its change can be applicable to expecting the Artic shipping routes, and many fields of science as well. KMA and Prof. Ji Hoon Jung, the JeonNam University, have been developed the exclusive technique for precise prediction in sea ice changes. The analysis of seasonal change characteristics in sea ice  based on a statistical methods is used for the prediction and its forecast results up to three months are demonstrated in this webpage.  
systemsummary.passage = Polar Shipping Routes 
systemsummary.passage.content = During the summer in the polar region, shipping routes are opened up because of the sea ice reduction. To help with the people who need the information, we provides the sea ice extent and roughness information with different seven subregions in the Arctic.
